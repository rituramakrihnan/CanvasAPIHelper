**Overview:**
Students often face issues while accessing Canvas and submitting assignments, particularly when they move out of the country or encounter problems with verification. To address these issues, I am building an application called Canvas Assignment Submitter Application. This application allows users to submit assignments without logging into Canvas directly.

**Key Features:**

- **Simple Submission Process:** Users can enter their login ID, password, course number, course name, assignment type, and document.
- **Automated Submission:** The application sends the request and displays a message indicating whether the assignment was submitted successfully or not.
- **Convenience:** Eliminates the need to log into Canvas, making assignment submission straightforward and accessible.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Front End:** JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- **Back End:** Node.js

## What is Canvas?
Canvas is a web-based learning management system (LMS) used by educational institutions to facilitate online learning and teaching. It provides a platform for instructors to share course materials, assign and grade homework, manage student submissions, and communicate with students. Students use Canvas to access course content, submit assignments, take quizzes, and interact with their peers and instructors.

## How Canvas is Used
- **Course Content:** Instructors upload lecture notes, readings, videos, and other resources for students to access.
- **Assignments:** Students submit their homework, essays, projects, and other assignments through Canvas.
- **Quizzes and Exams:** Online quizzes and exams can be administered through Canvas.
- **Grades:** Students can view their grades and feedback on assignments and tests.
- **Communication:** Instructors and students can communicate via messages, announcements, and discussion boards.
