# CanvasAPIHelper

**Overview:**
Students often face issues while accessing Canvas and submitting assignments, particularly when they move out of the country or encounter problems with verification. To address these issues, I am building an application called Canvas Assignment Submitter Application. This application allows users to submit assignments without logging into Canvas directly.

**Key Features:**

- **Simple Submission Process:** Users can enter their login ID, password, course number, course name, assignment type, and document.
- **Automated Submission:** The application sends the request and displays a message indicating whether the assignment was submitted successfully or not.
- **Convenience:** Eliminates the need to log into Canvas, making assignment submission straightforward and accessible.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Front End:** JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- **Back End:** Node.js
